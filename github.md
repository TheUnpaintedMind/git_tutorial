# GitHub
*Suppose one day we don't have our device to store and manage files, so since we have a different device right now it would be better if there was a global entity from which we can access our files irrespective of any device. So GitHub is this global backup which stores repositories/files/folders and can be accessed anywhere.*

### Steps to create a GitHub repository

1. Create a GitHub account by going to the official [GitHub](https://github.com) website
2. After creating new account, sign in and create a new repository
